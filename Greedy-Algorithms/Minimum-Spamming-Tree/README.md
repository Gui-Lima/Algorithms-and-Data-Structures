# Minimum Spanning Tree
Minimum Spanning Tree, or MST, is a concept tied to the Graph data structure. A spanning tree of a given wighted graph is a tree that is a sub-graph of that graph, and connects all vertices together. A Minimum spanning tree is the one or more spanning tree that has less weight compared to the other spanning trees of that graph. That can be two or more MST to a graph, if they have equal length.

## Applications
Many graph applications have problems that involve making a MST of that graph.

## The Algorithm
There are two main ways of getting a MST: Kruskal and Prim. Each one is explained in it's own folder.
