# SubSet Sum problem
Given some numbers and a sum value, determine if it is possible to make that value from the numbers adding them. There are some variations of the problem, there can be negative numbers to make a sum =0, or positive numbers to add to a input value. This problem is actually a NP-complete problem and this dynamic approach is a pseudo-polynominal time.

## What is does
Given a set of positive numbers and a sum value, determine if it's possible to get to that sum using any combination of those numbers

## The Algorithm
Since is a DP approach, we will do a table.
