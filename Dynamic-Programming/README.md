# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a problem solving heuristic dating very early, because it comes from mathematics, yet it is applicable to Computer Science.
A Dynamic Programming approach is very similar to Divide and Conquer, thus one detail. To a problem be solveable trough DP it must have these two characteristics:
* Optimal substructure
* Overlapping subproblems

(The divide and conquer has non-overlapping subproblems)
This means, in other words, that the general solution must be findable through the combination subproblems solutions of that problem. And the other characteristic means that if we tried to solve it in a naive way, we would end up resolving the same subproblem multiple times.

To solve this, we usually use a table( matrix, array) to store the solutions to the subproblems we alredy solved, and check the table everytime we encounter a new problem to see if it's solved. We are talking at a high level of abstraction here, but will see this clearly if you see an DP solution to a problem.

## Applications 
DP has inumerable contribuitions to math, control theory, a lot of computer algorithms and approximation approaches to some problems.
