Important Algorithms and Data Structures to have in hand

The whole thing is a Clion project, but you can see the codes individually without having to download or have Clion.
The "Untested pseudocode" part is just a bunch of pseudo and untested code. They are well documented, though, so if you want to see
some generic algorithms, check that part.
