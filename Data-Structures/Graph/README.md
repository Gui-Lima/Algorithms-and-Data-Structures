# GRAPHS
A graph is a collection of nodes(x, y , z ,w...) and edges (x,y), (y,z). An edge (x,y) means x is connected with y.

## Properties
A graph can have some unique things or not. The most common ones are:
* Directed Graph - Means (x,y) is different from (y,x).

* Loops - If a graph has Loops, there can be edges like (x,x).

* Fully connected - Means there is a path to every node from every node.

* Weight - Means associated to an edge, there is a number meaning how much it costs to go trough that edge.

There are many many more.
There is some nomenclature to it also, but the simples ones you can get from context and the harder ones are too hard for me to put here.

## Representation
There are two main graphs representations in programming: Weighted and non Weighted. A Weighted graph has a cost when going from one node to another. A non weighted has no such cost.
There are some ways to represent either, in each folder you can see how each one is implemented.

## Aplications
Graphs can widely used in real life for many many things, any network, virtual or real, like strees in a city, or some router network for data to pass. Social networks can use graph theory for recommendations, also. You can check a tonzillion applications for Graphs, so it's nice to learn it and the algorithms associated with them.

## Common Topics
Topis that make sense when talking about graphs are:
* Dijkstra Algorithm
* BFS and DFS
* Graph Coloring
* Minimum Spamming Tree
* Shortest Path
* Optimal path
